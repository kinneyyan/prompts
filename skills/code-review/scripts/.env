# =====================
# Glob Pattern Support
# =====================
# This script supports glob patterns for flexible file matching:
#
# Supported Glob Syntax:
#   *  - Match any characters (zero or more)
#   ?  - Match any single character
#
# Pattern Examples:
#   *.lock        -> Matches: pnpm-lock.lock, package.lock, yarn.lock
#   *-lock.*      -> Matches: pnpm-lock.yaml, package-lock.json
#   *.test.ts     -> Matches: Button.test.ts, utils.test.ts
#   *.spec.js     -> Matches: api.spec.js, unit.spec.js
#   openspec      -> Matches: openspec (literal string, directory or file)
#   .specify      -> Matches: .specify (literal string, hidden file/dir)
#
# Notes:
#   - Use spaces to separate multiple patterns
#   - Literal dots (.) are automatically escaped to match only actual dots
#   - Standard glob ** (recursive wildcard) is NOT supported specially;
#     it will be treated as * (matches any characters including /)
#   - Character classes like [a-z] are NOT supported
#
